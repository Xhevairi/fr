Update Droplet Console
To enable the Droplet Console, log in to your Droplet as root or as a user with sudo access. 
Once connected, download and execute the agent installation script with the following command to enable the console immediately:
    wget -qO- https://repos-droplet.digitalocean.com/install.sh | sudo bash

If you need to use the recovery ISO or can't connect using the Droplet Console, use the Recovery Console instead.

wget -qO- https://repos-droplet.digitalocean.com/install.sh | sudo bash
