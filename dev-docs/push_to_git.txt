…or create a new repository on the command line:

echo "# fr" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Xhevairi/fr.git
git push -u origin main

git remote add origin https://github.com/Xhevairi/fr.git

1. Remove the Existing Remote
    git remote -v
    git remote remove origin

2. Update the Existing Remote's URL
    git remote set-url <REMOTE-NAME> <NEW-URL>

A complete example with origin as the remote name and a URL to a 
real repo could look like this:
    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/git/git.git

3. Rename the Existing Remote
Easy. Rename the existing remote before adding the new one. 
Just run the following command and you're set: 
    git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>

So let's say you want to rename your origin remote to backup. You'd simply run: 
    git remote rename origin backup

How to create the global gitignore for your system
The global ignore file can go anywhere. Usually it is kept in the User’s home directory.

Create the file:
    touch ~/.gitignore_global

Add the file to the Git configuration:
    git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
Edit the file with your text editor and add your rules to it.

See all ignored files
    git status –ignored
